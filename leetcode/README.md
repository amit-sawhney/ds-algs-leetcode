# Summary

The leetcode folder will not be a place where leetcode problems are solved. In an interview, there will be no access to code hints, code completition, or warnings/errors. 

The primary purpose of this folder will be to store my solutions with documentation behind the solution, why it works, and the thought process that went into solving it
